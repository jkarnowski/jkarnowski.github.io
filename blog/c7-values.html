    <h4>What Matters Most to Me?</h4>
    <p>Last week I explored how I may have been affected by the theory of stereotype threat because I am a woman. That just acknowledging my gender - hey, I'm a girl in AP Calc - might hold me back from demonstrating my full knowledge because someone somewhere thinks that women can't do as well at math and science. Did they forget the first computer programmer's were women?</p>
    <p>This week should be more uplifting because I'm about to figure out ways to combate and overcome the stereotype threat. By recognizing and affirming my values, I'll be able to call on my strengths to fight off the negativity of a threat.</p>
    <p>Some roads are crossing right now. In my work as a coach for new teachers, we talk about setting strong vision for where you want your classroom to be by the last day of school. In order to put that together, we reflect on our values - what drives you? what motivates you to do well? how can you demonstrate those values for your students? Because in the end, a vision statement is a way to piece your values together. And the other road crossing is thanks to lululemon. As part of my development training, I went through an empowering reflection process to reveal and affirm my core values and that turned into my 10-year vision <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1JiW663sJYXeW56b1c3dkZSanc/preview">here</a>!
    <p>When I think about times in my life when I'm at my happiest or most satisfied, a few values come to mind:</p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>faith, family and community</li>
        <li>philanthropy</li>
        <li>adventure and nature</li>
        <li>ambition</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>How much do I try and live up to these values?</h4>
    <p>Well, great question. In my head, I immediately organized my values into a grid against a scale of 1(not often) to 5(very often). If these values are important to you, feel free to click through this sweet little grid, too!</p>
    <p><iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1xh9FGZgp3BbAZSoI4YYYvkcKYP9ZyiLpn5efby6hOQk/viewform?embedded=true" width="760" height="500" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loading...</iframe></p>
    <p>I'd have to say I don't demonstrate each of these values everyday. But I do quite often. Faith takes the cake and I'm interested in doing more in the community to serve others.</p>
    <p>One of the values that I can feel the strongest connection with is being in nature. When I go hiking or run on a beach I feel grounded, balanced and fully alive. It is when I hear God the loudest. It is when I set big goals for my life. If you want to know me, let's get into the mountains or raft down a river.</p>
    <p>Because these values are important to me, I hope that others see me living a life centered on faith and family, philanthropy, adventure and reaching big goals. I definitely get asked about my adventures! I act on living adventurously often: moving to San Francisco, traveling throughout Patagonia, and a big one - living in Santiago, Chile. I get asked often about Chile: best places to go, where to stay, what to do, etc. Most recently I've been able to talk about my faith and where I go to church.I haven't reflected often on the connection between conversations with others match up with my values so it feels good to know that I get asked about my faith because it is so important to me and if you don't know that about me, I would need to examine my personal integrity.
    </p>
    <h4>Will these values be enough?</h4>
    <p>YES! I believe....</p>
    <p>The more I trust in God's plan for me, the more confident I feel taking one more step forward.</p>
    <p>To overcome the stereotype threat that women can't do as well as men in math, science and engineering is tough. I actually don't know if I'll be able to recognize it. And then there are the <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_04032015_web.pdf">statistics</a>. But, how many US Americans go live in Santiago, Chile? I struggled through cultural assimilation and language barriers...I've got some experience living in a world where I'm a minority.</p>
    <p>If I feel like I'm struggling in DBC, I can draw on my past experiences as a Teach for America corps member, as an expat living abroad, and as a women breaking down ceilings in STEM. I am paving the road I want to walk on and it is going to require some sweat. And some naps.</p>
