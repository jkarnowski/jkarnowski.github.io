    <h5>Prompt: Discuss a time you had conflict. What was it about? What happened?</h5>
    <p>Yikes. This creates a space for me to feel vulnerable online and publically talk about my emotions. And, conflict can be internal, with someone else or with a group; I'm going to talk about the internal, conflict with self. Any conflict with one or many people stems from some expectation that I have for myself and others so if I understand my own way of recognizing and working through conflict of self, I should (should..) feel more comfortable in a conflict with others.
    </p>
    <p>A recent conflict I went through was deciding to get married on a beach in Kuaui, Hawai'i. Pablo and I got engaged on a Thursday and he proposed to get married <em>the next day: Friday</em>. The conflict: what would my MOM say/do? Would she be upset? Sad? Excited? How would she react?</p>
    <p>...We got married</p>
    <p>I realized that for us - me and Pablo - it was the perfect way to celebrate our love and become one team. And when I thought about us, it made sense. When I thought about <em>others</em> I started assuming thoughts, emotions and actions of others. Not a good use of energy.</p>
    <p>Where was this conflict coming from? At first, I thought the conflict was that I feared disappointing or upsetting my Mom. Even deeper, I was scared/excited to commit to getting married so I was using my Mom as a first line of defense. As soon as I realized that - hey, it isn't about Mom, it's about YOU - I asked myself, do I want to be in a marriage with Pablo?</p>
    <p>Absolutely YES!!!!</p>
    <p>So, let's have FUN and get married on an adventure, just how we life our life!</p>
    <p>When we got back to San Francisco, I felt amazing and excited and so incredibly loved. I am SO happy we got married on a beach at sunset. Just us.</p>
    <p>I know that in the last year I have become more attuned to breaking down my emotional response and with each conflict, I get a bit closer to understanding why I experience certain emotions. Thanks to DBC, I am peeling back more layers of ME and learning so much about who I am in this world and how this world is part of me. Beautiful, exciting and so empowering!</p>
