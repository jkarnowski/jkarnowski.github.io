    <h3 class="header">My Thinking Style</h3>
    <h5>15 de mayo 2015</h5></header>
    <p>I took <a href="http://www.thelearningweb.net/personalthink.html">this</a> short online quiz to reveal my thinking style and was not surprised with the result.</p>
    <p>As an educator and coach to new teachers, I'm surprised and frustrated that I haven't come across this study and quiz before. Why? This information is powerful and meaningful for teachers - as learners - and teachers - as teachers.</p>
    <p>So often I worked to reveal how my students learn best but I never considered that their <em>way of thinking</em> is not the same as their <em>way of learning</em>.</p>
    <p>If I step back out of my role as teacher and put on my student hat I am very excited about the clarity I've gained in how I think and that it isn't the same as how I learn. I feel empowered and awakened!</p>
    <p>However, I am hesitant to wear a name-tag that says: "Hello, I'm a Concrete-Random Thinker" and wear the label. You know how you have to check a box for race or gender or occupation? I get that strange gut feeling when I am asked to check those boxes. Yes, I identify as a white female and my occupation box: education is usually on there. But when you unpack that classification "white" that means I'm not....x, y or z. Yup, that's a conversation for another day.<em>ha, what a prime example of a random thinker...</em></p>
    <p>But when I think about my thinking-style: concrete-random and its signature thinking traits like:
      <ul>
        <li>enjoy experimentation and discovery</li>
        <li>concrete: use your 5 senses to understand the present, don't look for hidden meanings or imaginative ideas or feelings</li>
        <li>organize information in chunks, and in no particular order. No need to follow all the steps or even follow them in 'order.'</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>I searched for more information about the concrete-random thinking style and found this amazing resource (below). I can check off almost everything on this list!</p>

    <h3 class="header">Thinking Style != Learning Style</h3>
    <p>
      I love to learn. Now I can add that I am fascinated by the science of learning - <em>how do we learn best? what strategies help me learn?</em> I truly and deeply believe that learning leads to growth and to grow as a sister/educator/global citizen, I need to continously learn and develop. One of my values in life is to live with a sense of possibility. Believe that your vision is possible.</p>
      <p>But it isn't easy. I have struggled to learn. I get stuck and feel like my head is jammed into muck and darkness. When I first tried to write some methods from <a href="http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/">Learn Ruby the Hard Way</a> I typed character by character without seeing how it worked or why something didn't work. I'd feel frustrated that I wasn't 'seeing it' but I didn't want to stop trying. I wanted to figure out how to solve a coding challenge but recognized my low skill level and ugh, that just isn't fun.</p>
      <p>There are times where I get so focused I can't see any other way of solving a problem. I'm learning about that: the diffused mode and focused mode in our brains. Now I know that I perceive new ideas and skills with a concrete perception: I need to see/feel/hear what is going on to develop an understanding. I'm not so good at starting with the abstract and imaginative way of thinking about something new. Makes sense why I learned Spanish while living in Santiago - I could hear it everyday! Back to learning code...
      </p>
      <p>I like learning to code because it is experimental. I can try something and see what I built right away. This past week was our intro to CSS and my experience learning CSS positioning is a perfect example of how my thinking style affected my learning. I struggled with positioning my elements on my website and that is because I did not read a lot about CSS. I skipped some details and tried things on my own before reading the how-tos but still felt a gap in what I was doing with what I should understand. I knew I wasn't learning the positioning properties at a rate that would get me to a confident and comfortable place.
      </p>
      <p>How did I overcome that struggle?</p> Collaboration! Imagine that - learning with others is more powerful and meaningful than learning alone. I have some fabulous Grasshoppers and through a pairing session and a chat with a new friend I saw the bigger picture. Plus, I went to yoga, slept and came back to it the next day. Sometimes, sleep is the best strategy.
