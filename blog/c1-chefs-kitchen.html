      <b>What's your take on the DBC experience?</b>
      <br>
          I am excited, nervous and humbled that I get to be a part of Dev Bootcamp (DBC). I compare what I've done in 6 days as a student to my 2 years working towards my Master's in Education at ASU and they are fundamentally different experiences. My ASU classes followed the typical academic model: go to class, sit, listen, write some notes, relate something to my classroom, maybe try something new in my classroom, submit some papers that are meaningless. In 6 days I have read and created, researched to make my work better and asked questions that are relevant to my own learning. I've supported other students in their learning. It's been meaningful from the first task! The DBC experience is not like any learning experience I've had before.
          <br>In fact, it is more aligned with what I worked to realize with my students. I built up student mindsets so that they believed in their ability to learn math despite past experiences. I created opportunities for students to learn with their peers through group work, ask questions and engage in meaningful, culturally-relevant math. I tried to break the listen-to-learn model and facilitate discovery-based learning. I encouraged mistakes and valued student's mathematical reasoning versus focusing on right/wrong.
          <br>The experience sounds like the ideal vision for an education for a few reasons. The people and structure ebb and flow with the needs and feedback of its students. No curriculum or instructional model is just-right for any student and DBC acknowledges that and uses that as an opportunity to continue growing and learning as instructors and an organization. Also, DBC invites you to throw out your traditional view of education: sit in a seat, consume information, answer questions on a test and repeat. No, the students are makers and not the consumers of information. We must own our education by acting with curiosity and passion. Act first, apologize later.
          <br>In summary, the DBC experience is shifting the paradigm of education. It is unique, new and inspiring!

        What is your impression of DBC? How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
        <br>My impression of DBC is positive. I'm lucky and was introduced to DBC by a good friend that has graduated and gotten a job in development here in San Francisco. His anecdotes correspond to the experiences I have had so far with the students and staff of DBC. I've also met another alumni that has graduated and her feedback and excitement further validate the <em>buena onda</em> that comes from the students and staff at DBC.
        <br>I love this question about how I see myself engaging with the culture. I am curious. I make mistakes and like to know that they are expected and accepted. I see myself just being myself: outgoing, positive, and leading by example. Because I have a background in education as a teacher and coach for new teachers, I want to be mindful and considerate of the teachers. It isn't easy instructing to a group of people that all learn differently. But it is rewarding seeing your students grow and apply their knowledge in new ways.
        <br>There was an analogy that DBC is like a kitchen. You put on your apron and you start chopping. You take the compost out. You learn by watching others and trying it on your own. Don't just order an education from a menu, pay and expect the meal to be perfect. Why not create the menu, make it and re-make it? I want to chop and code alongside my peers. I want to listen to their dream menu and encourage them. I want to make it, toss it and feel supported to try again.

    <p>
        Have your expectations of DBC changed? If so, how?
        <br>They have. My expectations have changed because I did have a degree of the buy-consume-expect 5 stars mindset. But reflecting more on my experience as a teacher and what I wanted for my students has helped me come to a clearer vision for what I should expect for my education. I should expect that I will learn because I invest my time and energy into the concepts and skills that I want to learn. No teacher is serving me a new career on a platter. No chef knows my dream meal. I know what I want so I need to get it. The instructors at DBC have the knowledge and experience to guide me, to help me sort through my ideas and misunderstandings so I need to take advantage of that and be present and be aggresive about my learning.
        <br>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
        <br>I am beyond excited. I cannot wait. Actually, it has already started. I am excited to learn through doing. I am grateful for the instructors that will invest in our learning. I look forward to making lots of mistakes, laughing and learning from them. I cannot wait to celebrate my teammates' successes and breakthroughs. Sure, I'm nervous because my fear is that I might be in the wrong kitchen. I'm nervous to be behind on the learning curve. I'm nervous I might not know the right question to ask when I'm stuck. I'm nervous about leaving my comfort zone. I trust my instinct and my instinct led me to DBC.
        <br>I'm amazed at how much I have learned about myself and how much I have learned about computer programming in just 6 days!
