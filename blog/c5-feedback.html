    <h3 class="header">Pairing Up</h3>
    <p>Pairing:
      <ol>
        <li>What was it like to pair with others?</li>

        I love pairing with others! I have had so many positive and productive pairing sessions so far. I appreicate the structure that DBC has encouraged us to work with: check in with each other, communicate your vision for driving and navigating, and collaborate to solve a problem.

        I remember feeling nervous for the first pairing session because I didn't want to be the underprepared pair who didn't contribute. I was also curious - how are others feeling about moving through these challenges? Are their questions and struggles the same as mine? What drove them to join DBC? I love meeting new people and hearing your story so I look forward to the check-in a lot.
        <li>What was fun or rewarding about pairing?</li>

        The best part of pairing is encouraging someone else and supporting them in their learning. I think that a pairing session is successful when I can help you build up your understanding of what we are doing. I don't feel so great when I leave a session not feeling stronger in what I'm doing (that only happened once). 

        Another fun part of pairing is obviously getting the code to work the way we want! That feels SO good! 

        <li>What was frustrating or difficult?</li>
        It is difficult for me to speak up and communicate if the ebb and flow isn't working for me. When I feel confused by the content or off-balance in how we are working together, I struggle saying, "hey, can we pause? I'm not feeling it." I should probably just say that, right?
        You know what is interesting? I'd rather have a good vibe going on and not get a working solution than have an uncomfortable vibe and beautiful code.
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Feedback</h3>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>DBC and a culture of feedback</li>

        Oh, feedback. I appreciate that DBC takes so much time in setting a culture of feedback. They took time to set the standard for feedback so that we all are on the same page about what feedback looks and feels like, when it happens and how it should make an impact on your learning and pairing.
        <li>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</li>

        Impressed! Each piece of feedback is meaningful and relevant. Actually, a lot of it is what I was thinking when I reflected on our pairing session. I am grateful for the encouragement and positive vibes and equally empowered by the suggestions that can take me to the next level as a pair and web developer. 

        <li>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</li>

        I am writing my pseudocode on paper, in order as we talk through it. I think the first few challenges were 'easy' enough to talk through and write but someone mentioned that I should write the steps down as we go to stay organized. Done. I am and it is paying off - I was able to pseudocode and solve the first three challenges of the week <em>on my first attempt!</em>. Thank you, anonymous feedback unicorn. You encouraged me to do something simple yet powerful! 

        <li>How was it to write feedback? What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</li>

        I have experience giving feedback through my previous role as teacher coach. I'd observe a teacher, give feedback by using a rubric with pre-defined criteria and facilitating a co-reflection before showing my feedback. It was very structured and also included a value. That was tough.

        So, providing kind, actionable and spcific feedback is something I've done for a long time. But, this is a different environment and I don't know how much experience my fellow grasshoppers have with receiving and giving feedback. 

        I write feedback that I'd want to read about myself. If it is actionable, I'll have something to do differently because of the feedback. If it is kind, I'll nod and feel valued. If it is specific, I'll know


      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</p>
    <p>I think it is going to be an essential part of my learning experience for many reasons. 
      <ol>
        <li>Life is better when shared in community!</li>
        <li>Listening to how someone else is digesting what we are learning will help me strengthen my own understanding and also clear up links between chunks of learning that I haven't mastered. That has already happened!</li>
        <li>Teaching is the best way to learn so pairing with someone that I can encourage and guide to a stronger understanding is the best feeling!</li>
        <li>Feedback is a way for me to learn how others perceive me as a teammate - both in how they feel working with me and how much I contribute technically. I hope to contribute in meaningful ways and have some fun doing it, so I strive to hear that type of feedback.</li>
