    <h3 class="header">The stereotype threat</h3>

    <h3 class="header">Is it real?</h3>
    <p>Oh man. This question really gets my jets going. As a teacher, I saw this threat take over some students' mindsets. I can think of a handful of students that struggled because they let this threat move into their brain. I also know many students that crushed this threat - and I saw that process go down. That is what makes teaching amazing. But, I actually had to work hard to think about this in terms of my own personal experience. I need to consider my own experience, too!</p>
    <p>
     Yes! Have I felt that my performance was hindered because of the idea that women aren't good at math? Subconsciously, yes. Why? Because there is a little monster in my brain that sometimes whispers discouraging feelings into my thoughts. <em>"You won't get how to solve that problem."</em> Or, <em>"This isn't for you; you don't have the ability to do that."</em> And I shove that monster away but it doesn't go away completely. Believe me, it is a little monster with very little power. Just enough power to scare me for a few seconds, and maybe it held me back on a problem or two in high school Calculus. I read some <a href="http://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/07-08/gender-gap.aspx">research</a> about women in math. There is evidence that young girls are heavily influenced by their female elementary teachers that teach them math. If that teacher has math-based anxiety, that feeling is passed onto the young girls. Not the boys. INSANE. Imagine that. Little waves of low self-esteem emulate from the teacher and are absorbed by little fourth graders.

    <p>Let's think about my math background for a second.
      <ul>
        <li>high school math teacher, 5 years</li>
        <li>Master's in Secondary Math from Arizona State University</li>
        <li>tutor for college-level algebra and business calculus as a college student</li>
        <li>Finance major, because I thought there would be more applied math.</li>
        <li>math tutor for elementary students</li>
        <li>took AP Calculus, got a 3 somehow</li>
        <li>In third grade, I used to tutor the other kids in my class during class. Apparently I was like a little teacher's assistant. How did I not see that I would get into teaching?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>How is my math background relevant to the stereotype threat? Maybe it goes back to my Mom. She wanted to me to be an engineer - she saw how 'good' I was at math and science and sent me to an engineering camp at University of Michigan for two weeks when I was in middle school. I thought it was the WORST. But I actually really liked camp; I made my own nail polish! so cool. But, I didn't pursue engineering. I didn't even look into it. I thought it was way out of my league. For nerdy guys (sorry, future colleagues and friends). So, I'm thankful that my will and confidence have almost squished that little monster completely.</p>
    <p>But, I didn't think about my own experiences with stereotype threat at first. I actually jumped right into my former students' shoes. I taught in at-risk schools where more than 80% of the students come from families that live at or below the poverty line. So, very different from my small town, upper middle class upbringing. My students faced the stereotype threat on a daily basis. The correlation of at-risk and race is strong and undeniable. Most of my former students are not white. They are black, Mexican-American, refugees from Somolia, or recent immigrants from Mexico. So, my role was not just to teach math. It was to learn how different my students' lives were from my own, listen and accept them for who they are - teenagers trying to figure it out. We talked about the statistics for black men in college. I showed them data that shows race and educational inequity in our country. And then we set out to break those numbers.
    </p>
    <p>My teaching experience gave me direct experience with the cycle of the stereotype threat. My students are smart, creative and full of personality. They have all the grit and hope they need to do well. I didn't know about the theory of the stereotype threat as a teacher but you pick up on that sense of "I can't do that; that's for...someone else." And that is tied to the growth vs fixed mindset. I did a lot of work throughout the year to teach my students about the growth mindset - that learning means falling down, that practice creates opportunities to get better. Can we squish the monster by believing that we can learn? I think so!</p>
