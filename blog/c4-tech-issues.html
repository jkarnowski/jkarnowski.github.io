  <section>
    <h3>two categories to consider</h3>
    <div class="circle_left">
      Safety
    </div>
    <div class="circle_right">
      Community
    </div>
    <p>When I think about <strong>safety</strong> and technology, I think about:
      <ul>
        <li>Who knows where I live?</li>
        <li>How can a hacker break some code and get my bank account information?</li>
        <li>How secure are medical records?</li>
        <li>Should I trust the boom of drones?</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Add in <strong>community</strong> and the branches of issues we face include:
      <ul>
        <li>(lack of) gender diversity in technology: as leaders, as developers, as thought partners</li>
        <li>education inequity: how does learning to code work to elevate all students - from elementary kids to community college students?</li>
        <li>Does technology bring us closer as a community or widen the gap?</li>
        <li>conversations and relationships: look around you right now. How many people are engaged in eye-to-eye conversations? what about eyes/fingers-to-keyboard interactions? What affects does that have on our community?</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I immediately thought about women in technology. The lack of women as thought partners in technlogy is unsettling. But I wanted to research something I didn't know much about.
    </p>
    <p>When I think about a bigger theme that links most of these issues, I think about how important it is to be educated. By seeking understanding and more knowledge of what technology enables us to do and how it works, how would that impact the decisions we make as community leaders, sisters, employees, business owners, etc.?
    </p>
    <p>For example, I have read a little bit about drones. I see and hear them in the parks and get annoyed by their presence. I get annoyed because the noise disrupts the sounds of birds, wind and my friends. It doesn't fit with the pattern of leaves on trees, clouds rolling across the sky and nature. Yes, it is an engineering feat and quite the achievement for science and technology. But something irks me with drones. It's a powerful toy. A weapon. A videogame that has come to life. It's a transformer!
    </p>
    <p>That leads me to a bigger, more abstract question - how are we distinguishing games (like a drone) from reality?</p>
    <p>Drones are used to kill people. Read about drones used by US soldiers <a href="http://www.livescience.com/37815-how-unmanned-drone-aircraft-work-infographic.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/digitalnation/interviews/shachtman.html">here</a>. How do I protest this? Why aren't we screaming "NO!" to the use of drones by the military? Do people know that is how technology is being used? Are we desensitized as a nation because the blood is shed somewhere else?</p>
    <p>The issue that I see is <strong>how our empathy for others is affected by advances in technology</strong>. To what extent am I desensitized by the horrors of war because of distance and technology? Do you see the victims of drone attacks as fathers? Grandparents? As your neighbor? I don't know anything about the business and politics of war but I fear that by distancing the attacker from its victim it changes the environment and takes a horrible situation into one that is more unjust. The attacker has the remote control, finds the target and pushes a button. Sounds like 99% of all video games.
    </p>
    <p>This may be a stretch but something I heard in yoga recently stands out: we are all one. We are unique personalities and have our individual identities but that is also what makes us like each other. We all have behaviors, emotions and thoughts that make us human. So who I am is because of my relation with you. You are you because you are not me.<em>following me</em>?</p>
    <p>Until I understand the positive impact that drones have on delivering food for cities in need, or dropping off critical medicine to rural communities or knocking down fresh coconuts high up on the tree, I think the growth of drones is an important issue in technology.
