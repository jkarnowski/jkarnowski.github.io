      <em>Remember how I started talking about my new adventure with learning to code over <a href="http://ohshecodessf.blogspot.com/">here</a>? I have a new home, thanks to Dev Bootcamp and Github!</em>

        Update: I started Dev Bootcamp and this is week 1 of an 18-week journey!

        <li>What are the benefits of version control?</li>

      Wait, what is <b>version control?</b>

Let's say you are writing a blog entry (ha!) and have lots of funny ideas so you dump them into a file. You save just the initial ideas. The next day you work on developing a story around Funny Idea about Kale. Save with git. That means git has a version of your file before Kale and after Kale.

      <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</li>
        Github is the online storage place for your files that you save with git. It isn't an automatic relationship between git and github though. Don't be fooled. Git is software on
