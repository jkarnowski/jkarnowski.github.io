      <em>Remember how I started talking about my new adventure with learning to code over <a href="http://ohshecodessf.blogspot.com/">here</a>? I have a new home, thanks to Dev Bootcamp and Github!</em>
      <br>Update: I started Dev Bootcamp!

      <p><h3>A few reflections from Week 1:</h3></p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>What are the benefits of version control?</li>
          <br>Wait, what is <b>version control?</b>  Let's consider this situation: Marley, Diddy and Beyonce are a team and working on a project together and have one file: Change the World through Dance.
          <br>Version control allows each contributor to work on the project without interrupting someone else's work <b>and</b> maintain the integrity of each person's unique work. It eliminates the need to send the newest version back and forth through lots of emails. <br>Let's imagine B, Diddy and Marley all adding text and inserting sounds at the same moment in time. But <em>oops!</em> Baby Marley hit all the keys on his dad's keyboard and did some funky stuff. No worries! Version control maintains each saved point because life happens.
          <br>The major benefit of version control is that it creates efficiency for people working on teams or a person that works across multiple devices.
          <br>
          <li>How does git help you keep track of changes?</li><br>Git is the software on your computer that allows you to save and keep track of your edits as you go. Let's say you are writing a blog entry (ha!) and have lots of funny ideas so you dump them into a file. You save them to a file. The next day you work on developing a story around Funny Ideas about Kale. Save (with git). That means git has a version of your file before Kale and after Kale. You can revert back to your original document pre-Kale.
          <br> The key work here is "track" because git stores what was changed in a document, who changed it and at what time. Talk about accountability! This is awesome because if need to ask a follow-up question to a teammate about their changes, you know what they changed, when they did it and who to go to for that change.
          <br>
          <br>
          <li>Why use GitHub to store your code?</li><br>Github is the online storage place for your files that you save with git. Let's go with another short story. You and your soccer team have a spreadsheet with player information: name, phone number, birthday and shoe size. Plus it has the league schedule, favorite watering holes for post-win celebrations and everyone's brackets for the World Cup.  If that file is saved to Github, everyone on the team has access to the file, can create a local copy (called: clone in git lingo) on their own computer, make changes and submit them to the team. When Captain Jaclyn submits a change to the document, everyone else will see that change. Let's get a bit more technical.
          <br> Github allows a team to have a master folder called a repository. Each person on the team can create their own copy that is saved in their personal space. That's called <b>fork a repository.</b> That's still just on Github in the Internet. Now what if you want to work on that file but don't have access to Internet? You need a copy of that file on your computer! You can clone your repository and have that same file on your computer. It gets even cooler. You can merge your local copy to your Github repository so that changes you make from your computer also get added to the Github file. Remember working on group projects in high school? Everyone had a different role to complete? Github allows teams to work together and bring their individual work together easily.
          <br>p.s.It isn't an automatic relationship between git and github though. Don't be fooled.
