    <h3>So, I got married last Friday.</h3>
    <p>
     hey world, I'm a married woman now! Needless to say, my study routine was a bit....shortened and hastened last week. I didn't spend as much time studying as I have up to this point and I can feel it. The great thing is that I learned enough JavaScript to dive into some challenges and get some code working in 3 days before the trip and picked it back up after a four day marriage break.
    </p>
    <p>A few things came up while learning JavaScript in just 4 days.
      <ul>
        <li>how is a function different than a method?</li>
        <li>what's with the weird syntax?</li>
        <li>looping. when will I have my ah-ha moment with setting up loops?</li>
        <li>WHY JavaScript? Why would I choose to use JavaScript? What situation calls for me to go into my JavaScript skills? When do I use it (versus Ruby?)</li>
    </p>
